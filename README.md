Spell letters as you type them

This little project is for my 3-years old daughter, who loves to type on my keyboard.
Now the letters she stikes appears on screen with different colors and sound!

Very simple, but very effective.
She knows verys well a few letters: B, O, S
Some letters she knows but not so well: F, M, I
She's familiar with the others, but doesn't know them 100%

Luckily with running this little program 5 min every day, she will know 100% all the letters in a few weeks?
